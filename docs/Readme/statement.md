As a Software Development Manager my, primary, goal is to ensure an environment that enables success and gives the team a shared vision. That goal can be broken down into 4 sub goals. Those sub-goals are below in priority order:

1. Help my teams succeed here at our company.
   * Visible by seeing [success outcomes](./TeamSuccess.md).
2. Help the people I manage succeed here at our company
3. Help the people I manage succeed in growing their careers.
4. Ensure that our place of employment is, and remains a desirable place to work.
   * I believe this goal will be achieved by the fulfillment of the previous 3 items.

In the pursuit of the primary goal, I will work to ensure the sub goals achieved. I have given my-self a [rubric](./ManagerRubric.md) intended to help me know if I am creating the environment I wish to create.

The [rubric](./ManagerRubric.md), these goals, and their details are all living documents. As such, it is expected they will evolve as input is given, and data is collected.
